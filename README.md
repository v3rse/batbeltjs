Have you ever gotten tired of just consuming JavaScript libraries like `jQuery` and  `lodash` without really learning how they work? I eventually did. So I decided to write a JavaScript utility library to learn some features of the language and learn how it works with the DOM.

I don't, in any way, intend this to be used in production (*although you never know with these things* :wink:). Some of the code here may really be disgusting :astonished:. I'm still on the path to being a sage :neckbeard: JavaScript developer. Viewer discretion is advised. This is just a learning experiment with accompanying blog posts (not finished yet).

If you're interested in contributing don't hesitate to send a Pull Request or create an Issue. I'm excited to see what best practices people may suggest. Hope we can learn new stuff together.

__P.S. got this idea from Infinum's [learnQuery](https://github.com/infinum/learnQuery). Check it out.__
